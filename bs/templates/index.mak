        <p>BioScript is a python library aiming at regrouping & running bioinformatics scripts
        through a common and simple interface. It can be used at the command line or using a web service. Bioinformatics scripts
        are displayed and used as a traditional `form` way.</p>

        <p>
        The addition of new scripts does not require advanced computational skills and is facilitated
        by the plugin system in the application. It is designed to be simple and fast.
        </p>

        <p>
        BioScript is built to be easily plugged into any third party application through a cross-domain programming
        interface. BioScript can be used and accessed from any web application.
        </p>

        <p>
        Simple & straightforward, with the complexity hidden for end-users, it allows quick installation and access
        to multiple tools. End-users may ignore where and how the operations are launched: on a dedicated machine with
        adapted CPU & RAM.
